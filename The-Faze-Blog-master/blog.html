        <p class="open">FaZe Sniping made its debut on YouTube on May 30, 2010.[1] Originally, the group were a Call of Duty clan founded by three players, Eric "CLipZ" Rivera, Jeff "House Cat" Emann (now known as "Timid") and Ben "Resistance" Christensen.[2] The trio garnered a reputation for innovating trickshotting. Trickshotting had existed in the past, but FaZe was one of the first to do it as a team. Their YouTube content took off when "Fakie" joined the clan. It was then when FaZe unveiled the most popular series on their channel, ILLCAMS.[3] In 2014, Thomas "Temperrr" Oliveira, who was running a lot of FaZe's operations, had Richard 'Banks' Bengston move in with him. After that moment, FaZe's content creators incorporated lifestyle content with their gaming content.</p>
        <p class="close">Faze CSGO Roster till date is one of the best CSGO rosters to ever exist with some big names such as Olofmeister, Rain, Niko and ColdZera. Faze have participated in numerous Esports competitions and have many too. Their latest run in ESL One Road to Rio came to an end when they lost to Astralis which is currently the number one Counter-Strike team in the world. And wiith this Olofmeister has decided to go on a break and now FaZe are left looking for a new memeber to play in his absence at DreamHack 2020.</p>
